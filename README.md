# consequences-hue

consequences-hue is an addon for [Consequences](https://github.com/JosephDuffy/consequences) that exposes the Philips Hue family of products to Consequences.

## Status

consequences-hue is currently in development. It currently has **basic** support for lights, but this will expand over time.

## Building

This addon uses TypeScript and needs to be compiled to run. For this there are 2 scripts included:

- `npm run build` - Builds the *.ts files in the `src` directory in to the `dist` directory
- `npm run build:watch` - Same as above but will perform another build when file changes are detected
